0) login to the system and become a root user

To start a root shell (i.e. a command window where you can run root commands), starting root's environment and login scripts, use:
sudo -i     (similar to sudo su - , gives you roots environment configuration)

To start a root shell, but keep the current shell's environment, use:
sudo -s     (similar to sudo su)
*sudo will not work if you're not in sudoers user list. In such case use "su root" and use root's password
